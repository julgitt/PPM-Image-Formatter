#### PPM IMAGE FORMATTER
A simple C program that allows you to format ppm images.
To run a program, call the program in the terminal with one of the parameters:

- "-blackwhite"
- "-filter" and rgb sub-string (e.g. -filter rb to print only red and blue color, without the green)
- "-contrast"
- "-gamma" and a second parameter which is a double value.
